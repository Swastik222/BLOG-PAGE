         <p class="font1">Abundance is a state of mind. You conceive it with your thoughts, intentions, desires and beliefs. You realize it with your actions, dedication, resolve and commitment. Just by sitting somewhere and day dreaming, none can become successful or rich. Saying so would be naive. Our thoughts precede our actions, almost always. We think before we act, even when it appears we are not. Everything begins as an idea in a fertile mind and materializes through actions. Thus, there is a thought process behind every action we indulge in. When our thoughts and actions are in harmony with our deepest aspirations and intentions and when we are attuned positively to believe in ourselves, we make possible our hopes and dreams.</p>
         <p class="font1">Our thoughts have a power of their own. If we know how they work and how to make use of them effectively, we can accomplish a lot more in our lives. Our thoughts reach out to others, through our words and expressions. They influence people both positively and negatively. They help us to make sense of the world and interpret our experiences according to our emotional states and perceptions. We value people, who are good thinkers and who have an exceptional ability to express their thoughts and resolve problems.</p>
         <p class="font1">People are successful or unsuccessful, rich or poor, mainly because of the differences in their thinking. Our mental states influence our circumstances and together they create the experience we call life. Positive thoughts lead to positive states of mind, bringing us their rich rewards. Negative thoughts influence us in negative ways, bringing us pain and suffering, subjecting our minds to destructive thoughts and distracting emotions and reducing our ability to think normally or function effectively.

An idle life is a product of morbid thoughts. A mind fired by the power of imagination and the desire to achieve finds little value in harboring idle thoughts. When matched with corresponding effort and enthusiasm, it will lead to greatness, transcendence and abundance. By changing your thinking and beliefs, you can overcome the limitations of your mind and your circumstances and achieve an expansive state of mind. Your mind is the key to your success and progress. It is the powerhouse of your thoughts and beliefs. It is where your dreams and ideas take shape. Hidden in it are your immense potentials and unknown possibilities. It makes possible who you are and what you can do. Because of that we have awareness, knowledge, sensitivity and intelligence. Because of that we experience and control the very process of existence and intelligent awareness.</p>
          <p class="font1"><br>Pay attention to what you think mostly. Avoid frivolous thoughts.
<br>Believe in your ability to manifest your thoughts.
<br>Clearly know what you want and focus on it.
<br>Dispute your negative thoughts using positive ones.
<br>Think deeply until you have weighed all the options.
<br>Be realistic, but know you can create magic with your thoughts and actions.
<br>Do not let others control your life. Empower yourself.
<br>Cultivate relationships with people who are successful and positive.
<br>Stay focused on your strengths and positive outcomes.
<br>Avoid people who are by nature negative and critical.
<br>Organize and prioritize your resources and tasks.
<br>Frequently visualize your goals to remember them.
<br>Use positive affirmations to reinforce your thoughts and beliefs.
<br>Keep an open mind to see new possibilities and alternatives.
<br>Improve your vocabulary and communication.
<br>Practice meditation and mindfulness techniques to remove negative energy from your mind and body. </p>
